# Gumroad - Email marketing prototype

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MauFrontier/gumroad-email-marketing)

Author: **Mau Fournier**
Applying for the role of **Customer Supporter** (with design and engineering tendencies ðŸ˜‰)

This project showcases my ability to quickly generate working Typescript + React code.  Check out [the Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/brvBekodG186nNxzCUkKLu/Email-Marketing-Mockups) which I prepared before starting this app. 

I also have experience with backend development, but not with Ruby on Rails yet (I'm usually on Node + Express.js).

## Usage

To run the app locally, run this command from the project directory:

`npm start`

## Testing

To run the tests, run this command from the project directory:

`npm test`
