# Gumroad - Email marketing prototype

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MauFrontier/gumroad-email-marketing)

Author: **Mau Fournier**
Applying for the role of **Software engineer**.

This project showcases my ability to quickly build Gumroad UIs with Typescript + React code.

It's also a sample of my level of comfort with Generative AI and my vision for how it can be harnessed to revolutionize the way people interact with Gumroad.

I hope you enjoy ðŸ™‚.

[Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/brvBekodG186nNxzCUkKLu/Email-Marketing-Mockups) I prepared before starting this app. 

I also have experience with backend development, but not with Ruby on Rails yet (I'm usually on Node + Express.js).

## Usage

To run the app locally, run this command from the project directory:

`npm start`

## Testing

To run the tests, run this command from the project directory:

`npm test`
